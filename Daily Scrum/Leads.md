### 6/13/22

**Progress Check:**
Chris:

- models, repository, and service layers are done for products
- decided not to implement the author name and publisher as separate tables
  - wouldn't be difficult to connect them, but to meet basic product goals, took them off
- BE should be done by the end of today or tomorrow
- Jose updated everyone on branching; issues have been created and pull requests have been made

Dhruv:

- models, repository, and service layers have been done
- currently working on controllers
- FE - Markus is working on carts; he currently has the bare bones set up
  - wanted to start a pull request but Dhruv asked him to pause on it and test it with mock data for now
  - had a basic layout of the cart; Dhruv will check his progress again tomorrow, if there is none, Jorge will take lead on that
- FE: Jorge A and Santi are working on Checkout
  - bare bones also created so far
- Testing should be happening soon (most likely tomorrow)

Calvin:

- Model, repository, service (basic version) -> done
  - login and register for the service layer + validation still needs to be completed
  - JWT also needs to be added in
  - more of the Service needs to be done
- Controller in progress (basic version almost done)
- JWT stuff will be completed most likely by tomorrow
- FE is not started, but we will work on those in our own time

Levi:

-

Overall:

- Style Guide meeting didn't happen today. Most likely going to happen tomorrow in the morning

Agenda:

- Taking on Roles and Setting tables - Levi and Calvin
- Order Details and Orders -> Dhruv
- Discussing the number of pages/forms for FE (Site Map)
  - Navigation bar based on the state of the application
  - Login
  - Register
  - Home: View Products (page with a preset amount of products, and once that works, we can add stretch goals)
  - Cart
  - Checkout
  - Past Orders
  - Profile (basic) -> so that we can View Past Orders
- Ideas/Stretch Goals:
  - Cookies
  - Help/FAQ page
  - Contact page - link with emails, etc.
- [Encryption](https://medium.com/developervisits/hiding-encrypting-database-password-in-the-application-properties-34d59fe104eb)
  - Jasypt
  - application.properties is set up right now so that it can easily be hacked.
  - we can prevent this by using environment variables via AWS (need to attempt this before we try it)
- CrossOrigin should not be "\*" in controllers (security & Sonar will fail)
  - it should be "http://localhost:8080"
- API port will be 8080 on localhost since this is defined in the settings
  - BE 8080
  - FE 5000
- To use or not to user DTOs (SonarCloud gets angry about this too).
  - These are defined in the service layer not the controller
  - The idea is to keep the models separate from the controllers
  - DTOs are just POJOs
  - Yes, this is seemingly duplicate code, but really easy.
  - only benefit for us is getting exposure to it
  - overall consensus: Calvin will just show a quick demo for the sake of exposure
  - https://github.com/Revature-Leafbound/Leafbound-API/security/code-scanning/4
    - will try to remove the security check for it if possible
    - calvin will try to figure it out tonight, but this may mean that peeps need to put it in themselves, etc.
- SonarCloud extension for VSCode (helpful and teaching some new things - sort of) = SonarLint
  - to test stuff out even before pushing it and creating a pull request
  - JPA, if you're doing CRUD methods, you don't need to do anything in your repository layer
    1. overriding method
    2. using the isPresent check
    3. throwing an error if not present
- Working on the Swagger Docs 2.0 tags (description is depreciated)
  - use "tags" not "descriptions"
- Postman can be created [api docs link](http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs)
  - Quick demo
- FE authorization - research it; Azhya will look up a demo to send to us
- Client Messages vs Status Codes for HTTP Responses
  - String messages or actual HTTP responses?
  - shouldn't have 500 errors as long as user stories are correct
  - User will do HTTP responses -> If User is done, Chris and Dhruv can look through the code to learn it
- Code smell
  - SonarCloud showing things that we don't want to show, esp during the presentation
  - we should have a threshold for warnings - get the code working first and then come back to fix those later
  - don't want code smells to begin with but warnings can wait, security issues should be fixed immediately
- Validation (business logic)
  - Create a Utility class for it
  - password -- 8 characters long, etc.
  - emails need to be unique
- Pathing for API: Queries vs Path : **Path**
- Branching and keeping track of features

  - **Color Palette** Adam's
  - Incoporating MUI
  - Roboto
- Updated User to not include Settings table - there's no security to it; it's a good user experience
- Service & JWT

  - Markus needs to change his code from JS to Angular

Jose:

- Finished Products BE
- Looking into testing
- Client Message Utils - need to be able to send products back
  - So far, from what we've been taught, we've been returning strings
  - how do we test returning an actual item? -> Render some dummy data and you could also implement an H2 database to use in your unit tests
- FE: Michael has started looking at it again, and Jose will also jump on that as well
