### Meeting: 6/12/22
**Agenda**
- [ ] Daily Stand Up
    - Markdown Syntax: https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/
- [ ] Issues
    - "Issues can be created in a variety of ways, so you can choose the most convenient method for your workflow. For example, you can create an issue from a repository, an item in a task list, a note in a project, a comment in an issue or pull request, a specific line of code, or a URL query."
    - want to be as specific as possible (i.e. for one purpose). We're using issues to create branches, and ideally, for every branch, we want them to adjust at most 2 files (like Service and ServiceImpl).
    - if you feel like more than 2 files are going to be changed (and this going to depend on the situation), then they may be tackling two separate tasks simultaneously, so you're going to want to create two separate issues for two different branches.
    - Reference for creating an issue: https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/quickstart
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline
